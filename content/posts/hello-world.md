Welcome to my personal website! I'm Paulo Jauregui, a Mathematics-CS professional exploring software engineering and machine learning.

This site will document my technical projects and learning journey, including:

- My K3s cluster (this site is actually being served by the server in my closet. How cool is that!)
- Software engineering and ML projects
- Technical tutorials and guides
