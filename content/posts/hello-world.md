Welcome to my personal website! I'm Paulo, a Mathematics-CS professional exploring software engineering, platform engineering, and machine learning.

This site will document my technical projects and learning journey, including:

- Kubernetes (this site is actually being served by the server in my closet. How cool is that!)
- Software Engineering and Machine Learning projects
- Technical tutorials and guides
