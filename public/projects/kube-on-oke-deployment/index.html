The challenge? Doing it without breaking the bank. The solution? Oracle Cloud Infrastructure&rsquo;s (OCI) &ldquo;Always Free&rdquo; tier and its Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE)!</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll walk you through my journey of setting up a two-node OKE cluster, leveraging those free resources, and navigating the inevitable troubleshooting that comes with any ambitious tech project. My goal wasn&rsquo;t just to get a cluster running, but to understand the nuts and bolts, especially the networking, which is so crucial in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Why OCI and OKE for a Free Tier Kubernetes Lab?</strong></p>
<p>Oracle&rsquo;s Always Free tier is surprisingly generous. For Kubernetes, it offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OKE Control Plane:</strong> Free for &ldquo;Basic Clusters.&rdquo; This means Oracle manages the complex Kubernetes master components for you.</li>
<li><strong>Compute Instances:</strong> Up to 4 Arm-based Ampere A1 OCPUs and 24GB of RAM in total, which can be configured as worker nodes. I decided to go for a 2-node setup, each with 2 OCPUs and 12GB RAM for a bit of resilience and a more realistic setup.</li>
<li><strong>Networking &amp; Storage:</strong> Generous allowances for block storage (200GB total for boot and block volumes), Virtual Cloud Network resources, and data transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seemed like the perfect playground to get serious Kubernetes experience.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Laying the Network Foundation (The VCN)</strong></p>
<p>Before even thinking about OKE, I knew a solid Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) was essential. I decided to go with a &ldquo;Custom Create&rdquo; approach for OKE, which meant setting up the VCN and its components manually first. This was a fantastic learning experience in itself.</p>
<p>Here’s what I configured:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compartment:</strong> I started by creating a dedicated compartment named <code>oke-project</code> to keep all my resources organized.</li>
<li><strong>VCN (<code>oke-vcn</code>):</strong> The main network, to which I assigned the CIDR block <code>10.0.0.0/16</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Subnets (Regional):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Subnet (<code>oke-public-subnet</code>):</strong> <code>10.0.1.0/24</code>. This would host the Kubernetes API endpoint and any public load balancers.</li>
<li><strong>Private Subnet (<code>oke-private-subnet</code>):</strong> <code>10.0.2.0/24</code>. My worker nodes would live here for better security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gateways:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Gateway (<code>oke-igw</code>):</strong> To provide internet access to/from the public subnet.</li>
<li><strong>NAT Gateway (<code>oke-natgw</code>):</strong> To allow worker nodes in the private subnet to initiate outbound connections to the internet (e.g., for pulling container images or OS updates) without having public IPs.</li>
<li><strong>Service Gateway (<code>oke-service-gateway</code>):</strong> This became crucial later! It allows resources in the VCN to access public OCI services (like OCIR, IAM) within the OCI network backbone, without traversing the public internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Route Tables:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default Route Table (for Public Subnet):</strong> I added a rule <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> -&gt; <code>oke-igw</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Private Route Table (<code>oke-private-rt</code>):</strong> Associated with <code>oke-private-subnet</code>. It got two key rules:
<ul>
<li><code>0.0.0.0/0</code> -&gt; <code>oke-natgw</code></li>
<li>&ldquo;All &lt;My-Region&gt; Services in Oracle Services Network&rdquo; -&gt; <code>oke-service-gateway</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Security Lists:</strong> I started with the &ldquo;Default Security List for oke-vcn&rdquo; for both subnets. This needed careful tuning later, as we&rsquo;ll see!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Creating the OKE Cluster</strong></p>
<p>With the VCN ready, I moved on to OKE:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chose &ldquo;Custom Create&rdquo;</strong> for maximum control.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Info:</strong> Named my cluster <code>oke-prod-cluster</code>, selected my <code>oke-project</code> compartment, and a recent Kubernetes version.</li>
<li><strong>Network Selection:</strong> Pointed OKE to my <code>oke-vcn</code>.</li>
<li><strong>API Endpoint:</strong> Selected <code>oke-public-subnet</code>. (My first hiccup was here – I later found out I needed to explicitly edit the cluster to &ldquo;Assign a public IP address to the API endpoint&rdquo; as it initially came up private).</li>
<li><strong>Node Pool Configuration (<code>arm-pool1</code>):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Managed</li>
<li><strong>Subnet:</strong> <code>oke-private-subnet</code></li>
<li><strong>Shape:</strong> <code>VM.Standard.A1.Flex</code> (Always Free eligible!)</li>
<li><strong>Resources per node:</strong> 2 OCPUs, 12GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Node count:</strong> 2</li>
<li><strong>SSH Key:</strong> Added my public SSH key (id_ed25519.pub).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Basic Cluster&rdquo;:</strong> Critically, on the review screen, I selected the option to <strong>&ldquo;Create a Basic cluster&rdquo;</strong> to ensure the control plane remained free.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, I hit &ldquo;Create Cluster&rdquo; and waited.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3: The Troubleshooting Gauntlet!</strong></p>
<p>This is where the real learning (and a bit of late-night head-scratching) happened!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>kubectl</code> Access - Problem 1: Private API Endpoint</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My cluster became &ldquo;Active,&rdquo; but when I tried to access it, the <code>oci ... create-kubeconfig</code> command from OCI included <code>--kube-endpoint PRIVATE</code>. My API endpoint, despite being in a public subnet, didn&rsquo;t have a public IP assigned!</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> I had to &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; the OKE cluster settings in the OCI console and explicitly check the box to &ldquo;Assign a public IP address to the API endpoint.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>kubectl</code> Access - Problem 2: <code>oci: executable not found</code></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With the public endpoint supposedly ready, <code>kubectl get nodes</code> on my Mac failed with <code>exec: executable oci not found</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> The kubeconfig generated by OCI relies on the OCI Command Line Interface (CLI) for authentication. I hadn&rsquo;t set this up on my Mac yet! I had to:
<ol>
<li>Install OCI CLI (I used Homebrew: <code>brew install oci-cli</code>).</li>
<li>Run <code>oci setup config</code>, providing my User OCID, Tenancy OCID, and region.</li>
<li>This generated an API key pair (<code>~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem</code> and <code>~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem</code>). I made sure to set a passphrase (the second time around! We&rsquo;ll get here) for the private key.</li>
<li>Upload the new <code>oci_api_key_public.pem</code> to my IAM user in the OCI console, deleting any old/unused API keys.</li>
<li>(I also learned to manage multiple kubeconfigs by saving the OKE config to a separate file like <code>~/.kube/config_oke</code> and using <code>export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config:$HOME/.kube/config_oke</code> in my terminal to access both my local and OKE clusters).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>kubectl</code> Access - Problem 3: API Key Passphrase Prompt (The Hang!)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After setting up OCI CLI, <code>kubectl get nodes</code> initiated a browser-based authentication. After authorizing, my terminal hung, sometimes with a key icon.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> The OCI CLI was waiting for the passphrase for my API private key! Typing that passphrase in the hung terminal allowed it to proceed. But only after realizing I had never set a passphrase and going through the process of reinitializing the credentials file with one (Step 2 above had to be revisited).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>kubectl</code> Access - Problem 4: Network <code>i/o timeout</code></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No more auth errors, but now <code>kubectl</code> gave an <code>i/o timeout</code> connecting to the API server&rsquo;s public IP.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> This pointed to a Security List issue. The &ldquo;Default Security List for oke-vcn&rdquo; (used by <code>oke-public-subnet</code>) needed an ingress rule to allow TCP traffic on port <code>6443</code> from <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> (the internet). I added this rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nodes Stuck: &ldquo;Updating (configuring)&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Registered Timeout&rdquo; - The Big One!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, <code>kubectl get nodes</code> connected but returned &ldquo;No resources found&rdquo;! In the OCI console, my worker nodes were stuck in &ldquo;Updating (configuring)&rdquo; with a &ldquo;Kubernetes node condition: Unavailable&rdquo; and a &ldquo;registered timeout&rdquo; error.</li>
<li>This indicated a deeper network prerequisite issue preventing nodes in the private subnet from properly bootstrapping and joining the control plane.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting Steps &amp; The Fix:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Service Gateway:</strong> I had missed this initially for the private subnet. I created a Service Gateway for my VCN, allowing access to &ldquo;All &lt;My-Region&gt; Services in Oracle Services Network.&rdquo; Then, I added a route rule in my <code>oke-private-rt</code> (the private subnet&rsquo;s route table) to direct traffic for these OCI services to the Service Gateway.</li>
<li><strong>Egress Rules:</strong> I confirmed the Egress Rules for the &ldquo;Default Security List&rdquo; (used by <code>oke-private-subnet</code>) were permissive (allowing All Protocols to <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>). This was already correct.</li>
<li><strong>The Breakthrough - Ingress Rules for Private Subnet:</strong> The &ldquo;Default Security List&rdquo; (still shared by both public and private subnets at this point) was missing a crucial <em>ingress</em> rule for VCN-internal communication. The OKE control plane couldn&rsquo;t properly communicate <em>to</em> the worker nodes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> I added an ingress rule to the &ldquo;Default Security List for oke-vcn&rdquo;:
<ul>
<li>Source: <code>10.0.0.0/16</code> (my VCN CIDR)</li>
<li>IP Protocol: <code>All Protocols</code></li>
<li>Allowing all traffic <em>from within the VCN itself</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Node Reprovisioning:</strong> After adding this VCN-internal ingress rule, I deleted one of the stuck worker nodes. OKE automatically provisioned a new one. This time, with all network prerequisites finally in place&hellip; success!</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Phase 4: Success! Two Healthy Nodes!</strong></p>
<p>The newly provisioned node came up with &ldquo;Kubernetes node condition: Ready&rdquo; and &ldquo;Node state: Active.&rdquo; I deleted the other stuck node, its replacement also came up healthy, and finally, <code>kubectl get nodes</code> proudly displayed:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
oke-cxqwiihujioa-nqkwomk4ra-...     Ready    node    12m   v1.32.1
oke-cxqwiihujioa-nqkwomk4ra-...     Ready    node    5m    v1.32.1
</code></pre><p><strong>Key Takeaways &amp; What&rsquo;s Next</strong></p>
<p>This journey was longer than expected but incredibly valuable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OCI Networking is Powerful but Precise:</strong> Every component (VCN, Subnets, Route Tables, Security Lists, IGW, NATGW, Service Gateway) plays a critical role. A misconfiguration in any one can have cascading effects.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting is Learning:</strong> Hitting these roadblocks and working through them taught me more than if everything had worked perfectly on the first try.</li>
<li><strong>Always Free is Viable:</strong> It&rsquo;s entirely possible to get a robust, multi-node Kubernetes learning environment on OCI without spending anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up for me? Deploying my personal website and blog to this shiny new OKE cluster! It&rsquo;s currently running on a local k3s setup, so migrating it to OKE will be the next chapter in this cloud adventure.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope this detailed walkthrough helps anyone else looking to explore Kubernetes on OCI&rsquo;s Always Free tier!</p>
